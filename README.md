[#Alexandria](https://whats-in.herokuapp.com/)
######Hosted by Heroku

Named after the famous library Alexandria is a place to share, collect, compare, and converse with like minded collectors.

Rather than tell people of your collections easily pull up images and show them instantly.

Search through our vast database of already collected items and share them on your shelf. Don't see any of your items? Alexandria is still perfect for you, create a custom shelf, add a picture and description of your item and show it off.

Items, usernames, and passwords are save to Mongodb for rapid comparison and recall to other users. Passwords and kept safe and secure using Bcrypt.

Search the Itunes library for images and information on your favorive movies or albums.

Start a group chat with other ###_Gwar_ fans to compare memorabilia and concert experiences.

Visit [Alexadria](https://whats-in.herokuapp.com/) and start your collection now.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
