Named after the famous library Alexandria is a place to share, collect, compare, and converse with like minded collectors.

Rather than tell people of your collections easily pull up images and show them instantly.

Search through our vast database of already collected items and share them on your shelf. Don't see any of your items? Alexandria is still perfect for you, create a custom shelf, add a picture and description of your item and show it off.

Items, usernames, and passwords are save to Mongodb for rapid comparison and recall to other users. Passwords and kept safe and secure using Bcrypt.

Search the Itunes library for images and information on your favorive movies or albums.

Start a group chat with other
